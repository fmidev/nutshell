Product generators
==================

In NutShell, a *product generator* is a shell script that computes something with given parameters and
saves the result as a file in a given path. As a precondition, for computation
the generator may need *product inputs* and request NutShell to compute them first. In this sense,
NutShell functions like ``make`` and ``Makefile``, where respective inputs are called *dependencies*.

Each product generator has a unique id consisting of lowercase literals and periods, for example: ``test.image.product``.
Certain directory names will derived from product id, replacing periods with slashes. For example: ``test/image/product``.

The generator has script has a fixed name, ``generate.sh`` .
