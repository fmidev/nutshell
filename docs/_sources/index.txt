Welcome to NutShell's documentation!
====================================


NutShell is a Python based facility designed for generating product files: images, data files and text files.
The product generation scheme resembles that of ``make`` and ``Makefile``:
if a product ("target") needs inputs ("dependencies"), they are generated first. 
NutShell suits to generation of real time products as well as to regenerating products on-demand
from archived data.

The applied *product generators* are organized systematically in a directory tree.
Each product has an ID of type ``my.data.prod`` that is mapped to path component ``my/test/prod/`` .
Hence, a product generator can be tracked to -- and essentially identified with -- such a
subdirectory containing generator script with a standard name (``generate.sh``).

The scripts can and should be designed so that they can be executed off-line, ie. independently of
NutShell. Upon *product request*, NutShell tracks and executes a respective product generator script,
communicating parameters -- file paths and product parameters among others -- as environment variables
to the script. This is "the amount of interface" any script should handle.
In addition, the product generator can query its desired inputs from NutShell using input
declaration script (``input.sh``).  

Otherwise product generators can be designed independently from NutShell. For example, no libraries or
other dependencies beyond production itself are required.

NutShell is suited to collecting programming efforts of several developers and researchers using
different languages and interfaces. '
It has been originally designed for weather radar products, but suits well for all kinds of on-demand product generation.
