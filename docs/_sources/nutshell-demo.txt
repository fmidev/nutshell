NutShell installation package comes with a simple demo using HTTP server
that can be started with::
  
  python3  -m nutshell.httpd -c nutshell-demo.cnf

Demo "products"
===============

The demo, appearing as the start page (index.html) contains three sample products:
  
#. ``demo.image.ppmforge`` -- Linux/Unix program generating fractal clouds and planets
#. ``demo.image.pattern`` -- Image Magick's convert creating built-in patterns 
#. ``demo.maps`` -- Map creation based on open map data and WMS servers

On the HTML demo page, one can change the values using HTML widgets and
click ``Update`` to regenerate the respective image product. In addition,
the filename (``$OUTFILE``) become updated in the first input widget.
There, it can be further edited for testing purposes. The HTML widgets 
on the page do not cover all the options supported by the generator scripts.

All of these are NutShell independent; their generator scripts can be run 
on command lines. For example:
