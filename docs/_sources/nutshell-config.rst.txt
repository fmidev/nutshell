   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Configuration
=============

NutShell needs only a simple configuration file. Helper script ``util/configure.sh``
can be applied to build one, ``nutshell.cnf``.

Example configuration
---------------------

A configration file might look like this:

.. include:: nutshell-tomcat.cnf


Configuration file may contain relative paths, which are expanded
with respect to working directory upon invocation. So for example::

  cd /some/working/dir/
  python3 -m nutshell.nutshell -c ./sub/dir/nutshell.cnf

will yield ``HTML_ROOT=/some/working/dir/html``, hence
**not** ``/some/working/dir/sub/dir/python``.
Whenever possible, absolute paths should be used.
