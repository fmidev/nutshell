Welcome to NutShell's documentation!
====================================


NutShell is a Python-based facility for generating product files:
images, data files and text files.  NutShell suits to generation of
real time products as well as to regenerating products on-demand from
archived data.

The product generation scheme resembles that of ``make`` and
``Makefile``: if a product (or "target") needs inputs
("dependencies"), they are generated first.  The applied *product
generators* are organized systematically in a directory tree.  Each
product has an ID of type ``my.data.prod`` that is associated with
path component ``my/test/prod/``.  Hence, a product generator can be
tracked to -- and in a way also identified with -- a unique
subdirectory, which also contains a *generator script* with a fixed
name (``generate.sh``).

Typically, Unix/Linux commands have a form like: ::

  command -i <input-file>  -p <parameter> -o <output-file>

Essentially, generator script is a wrapper for such commands.
  
Upon *product request*, NutShell finds and executes a respective product generator script,
communicating parameters -- file paths and product parameters among others -- as environment variables
to the script. This is the "amount of interface" a script is required to handle.
In addition, the product generator can query its desired inputs from NutShell using input
declaration script (``input.sh``).  
Otherwise product generators can be designed independently from NutShell. For example, no libraries or
other dependencies beyond production itself are required.

NutShell provides a platform for collecting programming efforts of developers and researchers using
different languages and interfaces. It has been originally developed for generating weather radar products [Peura2008]_,
but suits to product computation more generally.
