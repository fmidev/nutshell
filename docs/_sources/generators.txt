Product generators
==================

In NutShell, a *product generator* is a shell script that computes something with given parameters and
saves the result as a file in a given path. As a precondition, for computation
the generator may need *product inputs* and request NutShell to compute them first. In this sense,
NutShell functions like ``make`` and ``Makefile``, where respective inputs are called *dependencies*.

Typical Unix/Linux commands have a form like: ::

  command -i <input-file>  -p <parameter> -o <output-file>

Much in a way ``Makefile``s do, a generator script wraps such a line to something like: ::

  command -i $INPUT  -p $PARAMETER -o $OUTDIR/$OUTFILE


Product ID's, files and directories
-----------------------------------

Each product generator has a unique *product id* consisting of lowercase literals and periods,
for example: ``test.image.product``.
Respective directory names will derived from product id, replacing periods with slashes, 
for example: ``test/image/product``.

In NutShell, output files with dynamic content have syntax::

  <TIMESTAMP>_<PRODUCT_ID>_<PARAMETERS>.<EXTENSION>

for example: ::
  
  200508091630_test.image.product_SIZE=640,400.png

Static products do not have a timestamp, so they have syntax::

  <TIMESTAMP>_<PRODUCT_ID>_<PARAMETERS>.<EXTENSION>

Variable parsing scheme is explained in :ref:`nutshell-variables` .
In code, :ref:`nutshell.product.INFO` parses the filenames. 


The generator has script has a fixed name, ``generate.sh`` .


Setting up product generators
-----------------------------

  
#. Move to product generator root directory, ``GENERATOR_ROOT`` (See :ref:`configuration-file`)
#. Create shell script file ``generate.sh`` with execution permission.
#. Preferably, use **bash**, starting the script with ``#!/bin/bash`` 
#. Edit the script such that it finally writes its result in path ``$OUTDIR/$OUTFILE``

The generator scripts can and should be designed so that they can be
executed off-line, ie. independently of NutShell.

      
	   
User-defined variables
''''''''''''''''''''''

- Must not be any of :ref:`variables` (below)
- Must not contain underscores
- Should be short, to keeping resulting filenames reasonably short.

It is recommended that variables contain default values. In **bash**, they can be set for example
as follows::

  if [ "$WIDTH" == '' ]; then
     WIDTH='640'
  fi
  if [ "$HEIGHT" == '' ]; then
     HEIGHT=$WIDTH
  fi

or more compactly::
  
  WIDTH=${WIDTH:-'640'}
  HEIGHT=${HEIGHT:-"$WIDTH"}  # double hyphens to allow expansion

  

Input queries
'''''''''''''

#. Create shell script file ``input.sh`` with execution permission.

- Must not be any of :ref:`system variables`
